This project is a real-time chat application implemented using modern web technologies. The application allows users to register, authenticate, send and receive messages in real-time. The application is structured to run both frontend and backend service.

The project is divided into 2 main parts: the frontend and the backend.

- Frontend: Deals with the Chat Application's interface and makes sure that it connects to the backend to perform different functions such as registering users, logging in, or sending messages.

- Backend: Manage APIs and routes and database, and make sure that it can send information to the front end. Web Socket also lies in the backend to perform real-time communication between users.

---Information about the Chat Application:---

- When running the Chat Application, if you do not have an account, you can register for an account before logging in.
- When registering, enter your name, email and password.
  - Your email must be in the format: <name>@gmail.com
  - Your password must follow at least: One uppercase, one number, and one symbol.
- After logging in, the user can then create a chat with another users who already had an account.

---To run the project, do the following:---

'npm install' in the root directory, and in each folder (frontend, backend, and socket) do:

Frontend: npm install
Backend: npm install
Socket: npm install

To run the Chat Application, run the command in each of the folder separately:

Frontend: npm run dev
Backend: npm run dev
Socket: npm run dev

- If you did 'npm install' in the root directory and 'npm install' in all folders, you can also run 'npm run dev' in the root directory to run all 3 folders at once.

- You can do Ctrl+C in the terminal if you want to stop the program.
